                    inspire school kids to <b class="text-warning">fall in love with
                     coding</b>. Coding helps develop logical thinking and problem-solving
                     skills. Coding jobs are the future. They already constitute more than
                     60% of all the job in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math.
                     While still in school, those who start young will be ahead of everyone

                    In today's age, <b class="text-warning">coding </b>has
                    become an essential skill. Coding for kids helps them interact
                    with technology better. Studies also show that it aids in
                    holistic development of the child, improving cognitive
                    functioning as well as logical thinking.

                    means evolving cognitive, physical, and social skills of a 
                    hild to prepare them better for the interactions with the 
                    world. Coding as an activity not only involves mental
                    development but also focuses on social understanding.
